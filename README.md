## About the Project

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems, and the Daily Challenge provides a consistent way to improve problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these daily challenges. Feel free to explore the solutions for reference or as a learning resource.

## Directory Structure

The solutions are organized by date in the `solutions` directory. Each day's challenge has its own folder named with the date (e.g., `2023-12-10`). Inside each folder, you will find the solution(s) implemented.
